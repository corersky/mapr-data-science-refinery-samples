# Sharing Zeppelin Notebook

By default, Zeppelin stores notebooks in the local file system in your container. An alternative is to store them in MapR Filesystem. This allows you to share the notebooks with other users.

To store notebooks in MapR Filesystem, see [Notebook Storage](https://mapr.com/docs/61/Zeppelin/ZeppelinDockerRunParameters.html#concept_rhn_gb2_rbb__section_fbc_zv2_5bb).
