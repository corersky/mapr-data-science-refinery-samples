# Running Hive Queries
The Zeppelin notebook for this section contains sample of Apache Hive queries that you can run in your MapR Data Science Refinery.

Before running Hive queries, make sure you have [configured the Hive JDBC interpreter](https://mapr.com/docs/61/Zeppelin/ConfigureJDBCInterpreter.html#concept_b5l_xdk_qbb__section_a5z_d2k_qbb). Also, see [MapR Data Science Refinery Support by MapR Core Version](https://mapr.com/docs/61/DataScienceRefinery/DSRSupportByCoreVersion.html) for limitations when connecting to a secure MapR 6.1 cluster.

To run the notebook [Running Hive Queries in Zeppelin](notebook/running-hive-queries-in-zeppelin.json) just import it to the Zeppelin, click on  `Import note:` button and select the JSON file or put the link to the notebook:
