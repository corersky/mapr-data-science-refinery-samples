# Running Spark Jobs in Zeppelin

The Zeppelin notebook for this section shows how to run Apache Spark jobs using either the [Livy](https://mapr.com/docs/61/Zeppelin/ConfigureLivyInterpreter.html#task_t1d_4yj_qbb) or [Spark](https://mapr.com/docs/61/Zeppelin/ConfigureSparkInterpreter.html#task_t1d_4yj_qbb) interpreter.

> Note: The examples in this section use Hadoop commands to access files in MapR Filesystem. If you have a MapR Filesystem mount point in your container, you can replace the Hadoop commands with standard shell commands. Refer to Running Shell Commands in Zeppelin for an example of how to do this.
